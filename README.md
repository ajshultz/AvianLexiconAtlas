# bird_name-a-thon

This repository features the results and data for the paper "", which can be found TBD.

The Bird Name-a-thon Glossary & Gazetteer were create by Bird Name-a-Thon participants as they identified places or terms unfamiliar to them during name classification. 

The "final_decision_dataset.csv" file contains the common names, scientific names, and final classification category for each bird name descriptor. It contains the results of scoring for all rounds - Category 1 constains the classification if a single word descriptor was given, and category 2 contains the descriptor for a second word if present. Any references used are reported in the reference column, and any comments given by that scorer. The scorer ID column corresponds to the code for the participant who scored that name. All names were scored twice in the first two round (A and B), and any names that did not match in the first round were scored in three subsequent rounds (C, D, E). ESM_AJS_FINAL_DECISION correpsonds to the name assigned by ESM and AJS where there was still disagreement by the three scorers in the second round. The DECISION column contains the final category for that descriptor. Note that only the first descriptor was scored in the second round, and was considered for further analyses in the case where there was more than one descriptor term.

The "total_dataset_all_rounds_withdecision.csv" file contains the Family, Scientific Name, Common name, Descriptor considered, 

The family-level and species-level phylogeneies were those used for analyses in the publication. The citation for these phylogenies can be found in the PhylogenyCitation.csv file.
