# AvianLexiconAtlas

This repository features the results and data for the paper "", which can be found TBD.

The AvianLexiconAtlas Glossary & Gazetteer were create by Bird Name-a-Thon participants as they identified places or terms unfamiliar to them during name classification.

The "final_decision_dataset.csv" file contains the order, family, scientific name, English-language common name, final classification category, and general classification category for each bird name descriptor. 

The "total_dataset_all_rounds_withdecision.csv" file contains the order, family, scientific Name, English-language common name, unique descriptor considered, the non-unique group name, final classification category, general classification category, IOC scientific name, breeding continent, and the results of scoring for all rounds - Category 1 contains the classification if a single word descriptor was given, and category 2 contains the descriptor for a second word if present. Any references used are reported in the reference column, and any comments given by that scorer. All species names were scored twice in the first two round (A and B), and any names that did not match in the first round were scored in three subsequent rounds (C, D, E). ESM_AJS_FINAL_DECISION corresponds to the name assigned by ESM and AJS where there was still disagreement by the three scorers in the second round. The DECISION_FINAL column contains the final category for that descriptor. Note that only the first descriptor was scored in the second round, and was considered for further analyses in the case where there was more than one descriptor term.

The family-level and species-level phylogenies were those used for analyses in the publication. The citation for these phylogenies can be found in the PhylogenyCitation.csv file.
